## Linux WBFS Manager ##

This is yet another graphic WBFS manager for Linux. It uses libwbfs from Kwiirk and caristat (available from the authors at http://github.com/kwiirk/wbfs/tree/master).

**New in version 0.1.12**: patches from Andreas Henriksson:
  * fix home directory button
  * save and restore window position and size



**Standard disclaimer**: although I have successfully used this program with no problems, there is a possibility it might eat all your partitions. I offer no warranty whatsoever. Use at your own risk.

See the [requirements and compilations instructions here](http://code.google.com/p/linux-wbfs-manager/wiki/CompilationInstallation), and [usage instructions here](http://code.google.com/p/linux-wbfs-manager/wiki/Usage).
